## Introduction

In this work, we will try to generate and interpret decision trees and some other models, trying to take advantage of the possibilities R offers for data exploitation. For that purpose, we will use a dataset containing data about credits given in Germany. It can be retrieved [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%2).
